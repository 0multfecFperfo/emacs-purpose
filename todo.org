* Version 1.0 Requirements
Version 1.0 will not be considered ready until these tasks are completed
** DONE [#A] implement function pu:find-file 			     :UI:API:
** TODO [#A] regexp support for purpose detection (implement pu:buffer-purpose-name-regexp) :internal:
** DONE [#B] prefix-overload (overload commands on same key, with different prefix arguments) :UI:API:internal:
** TODO [#B] make pu:load-layout and pu:save-layout prompt for filename when called interactively :UI:
** DONE [#B] set good key-bindings for Purpose's commands
* Not Version-Related
Tasks that should be done, but not necessarily for a specific version.
** DONE [#C] display window purpose in modeline				 :UI:
** TODO [#A] frame support: design and write frame-related behavior and code :UI:API:internal:
** [#A] consider smarter function-call decision in pu:action-function
Which function to use, and how to call it (pu:switch-buffer, pu:pop-buffer).
Pending more usage-experience, suggestions and bug-reports.
** TODO [#B] pu:switch-buffer-with-same-purpose 			 :UI:
Like pu:switch-buffer, but choice is limited to buffers with the same
purpose as the current buffer.
** TODO [#B] make prompts better (more like IDO, more feature-rich)	 :UI:
Currently, the prompts of Purpose's commands don't have as much
features as IDO prompts have. Maybe there is a way to get all of the
IDO's benefits, and not only its nice completion.
** TODO [#B] automatic tests
** TODO [#B] adapt variables for customize				 :UI:
** TODO [#B] add to package repository (MELPA?)
** [#C] [MAYBE] improve/change default configuration		     :UI:API:
** [#C] refactor code (make it nicer and better)		    :endless:
** [#C] [MAYBE] add function delete-non-dedicated-windows
* Integration and fixes for working with other features (e.g. Dired) :endless:
